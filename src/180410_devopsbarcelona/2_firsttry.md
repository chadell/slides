<!-- And we came up with a super cool network design where each service runs a VPN service (in some platforms even as a SaaS) which connects it to a central routing engine using BGP to propagate routing information so we can get:
Only one set of connections to connect to everywhere
Dynamic control of reachability with route propagation
We tested with several virtual solutions on IaaS: VyOS, Arista EOS, Cisco 1000v, but the same could be achieve on-premises
We tested several architectures, such as DMVPN to optimize service to service direct connections 
We designed automated network operation running Ansible/Napalm and using a feedback loop using opensource such as PMACCT

so we went to the meeting with upper management...

<!-- 
the approach was not what they expected because we were not solving their most urgent issues
